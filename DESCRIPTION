Description: This packages implements the regression-with-residuals (RWR) approach to
  causal mediation analysis, allowing for post-treatment confounding of the mediator-outcome
  relationship. The rwrmed() function fits user-specified mediator and outcome models with
  residualized post-treatment confounders. The decomp() function implements a two-component
  decomposition of the total effect into the randomized interventional analogues of the natural
  direct effect (rNDE) and the natural indirect effect (rNIE), as well as a four-component
  decomposition of the total effect into the controlled direct effect (CDE) and the randomized analogues
  of the reference interaction effect (rINTREF), the mediated interaction effect (rINTMED),
  and the pure indirect effect (rPIE).
